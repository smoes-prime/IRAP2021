In Pymol, run script IRAP_prep.pml to download, clean, and align the structures. The script also exports a pdb of the structure produced as well as a fasta file for that structure.

In Schrödinger Maestro

Import structures that IRAP_prepalign.pml produces

Open Homology Modelling with Prime
-click simple viewer
-Click get pdb, and enter the pdb code you want, and select only chain A (Except for 4z7i, which has part of the ligand listed as chain C)
-There are two possible options here
  -Click BLAST homology search to find homology models, usually there is a pdb model with your chain that is a 100% match
  -Simply import the structure from IRAP_prepalign.py and use that.
-Click options and check the box for preserve residue numbers from template
-Click Build model

Combining the two structures
-Select Protein Chain A from the homology model, and everything except chain A from the template structure.
  -Before this step it may be necessary to do a protein alignment, click protein Structure Alignment, select both template and homology model so they are both in the workspace, then choose Use proteins from: Workspace, Reference residues = all, and click align, the results alignment should be essentially perfect, confirming our homology model is a perfect match to the determined structure, but with loops added.
-extract the selected atoms to a new entry

Open Refine Loops: Prime
-Select the newly created combined structure
-leave defaults
-click Find loops in workspace {Non Template}
-make sure the box is checked next to the loop(s) that are found
-click Option, and change serial loop sampling to Extended (15-20 subjobs)
-click run, it'll take quite a while unless your computer is extremely powerful, so now is a good time for a coffee break.

Open Protein Preparation Wizard
-Go to Import and Process tab
  -Select your newly built homology model with refined loops in the workspace
  -Leave defaults checked
  -Also check box delete waters beyond 5Å from het groups
  -Click preprocess
-If there are problems, you can often ignore them until after Hbond optimization, check to ensure they aren't egregious.
-Click preprocess

Switch to the Refine tab
- Leave default settings
Click Optimize

Click Remove waters (beyond 3Å)

Click Minimize

Now the structures can be exported from Maestro as pdbs and used in GROMACS
Note, structures with ligands require additional steps before they are ready for GROMACS.
